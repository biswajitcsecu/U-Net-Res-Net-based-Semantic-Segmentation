# U-Net-Res-Net-based-Semantic-Segmentation
Image segmentation is the method to partition the image into various segments with each segment having a different entity. Convolutional Neural Networks are successful for simpler images but not good for complex images. Here, this code implimentes the semantic segmentation using both Res-Nets and U-Nets for complex scenes.
